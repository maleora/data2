					The Radical Leap Re-Energized is an expansion and revitalization of The Radical Leap, which was named as one of the 100 Best Business Books of All Time by Covert and Sattersten.  It&#39;s a novel told in Steve Farber&#39;s humorous, poignant, and original voice that takes the reader on a deep exploration of the qualities and practices of real, or Extreme Leadership, and how to apply them in daily life. Part One, The Radical Leap, explores the leadership elements of Love, Energy, Audacity, and Proof; Part Two, The Radical Edge, takes the discussion deeper into innovation, personal clarity and guidelines for changing the world. It sets a new standard for what it means to really lead in today&#39;s business world...

				<h3>More About <span>The Radical Leap Re-Energized: Doing What You Love in the Service of People Who Love What You Do</span></h3>
				<p>Leadership is the art of mobilizing others to want to struggle for shared aspirations. Steve Farber, The Radical Leap Re-Energized: Doing What You Love in the Service of People Who Love What You Do // I believed that effective leadership could help people to accomplish a couple of significant things at work. First, it would help create a culture so vibrant and healthy that when people woke up in the morning and thought about the imminent workday they wouldnt be overcome with a sense of dread and wouldnt doubt whether or not they could survive the day.

				<p>Really great story line that kept you reading the whole way through. Hard to take notes on but a lot was learned. Great, inspiring and energizing. Still thinking about this book and the lessons weeks after finishing. I usually don&#39;t like leadership books that come in the form of a story. Usually, I find the storylines to be forced, trite, only somewhat engaging, and overall I feel that the lessons are force fed. Usually, the stories are super short. In that light, I can say that &#34;The Radical Leap&#34; by Steve Farber does not disappoint (mostly). His...</p>
