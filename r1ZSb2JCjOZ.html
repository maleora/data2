				<p class="description">
					She was one of the most sought-after women in the world. A top model who would stop at nothing to get what she wanted -- even another woman&#39;s man. And now she was dead, the victim of a brutal murder. Police lieutenant Eve Dallas put her professional life on the line to take the case when suspicion fell on her best friend, the other woman in the fatal love triangle. Beneath the facade of glamour, Eve found that the world of high fashion thrived on an all-consuming passion for youth and fame. One that led from the runway to the dark underworld of New York City where drugs could fulfill any desire -- for a price . . .

				<h3>More About <span>Immortal in Death</span></h3>
				<p>Summerset, don&#39;t you ever sleep?&#34;&#34;It&#39;s Lieutenant Dallas. She&#39;s--&#34;Roarke dropped his briefcase, grabbed Summerset by the lapels. &#34;Has she been hurt? Where is she?&#34;&#34;A nightmare. She was screaming.&#34; Summerset lost his usual composure and dragged a hand over his hair. &#34;She won&#39;t cooperate. I was about to call your doctor. I left her in her private suite.&#34;As Roarke pushed him aside, Summerset grabbed his arm. &#34;Roarke, you should have told me what had been done to her.&#34;Roarke merely shook his head and kept going. &#34;I&#39;ll take care of her. J.D. Robb, Immortal... We gotta have a toast.&#34; Rocky on her pins, Peabody used the table for balance. She managed to raise her glass without spilling more than half its contents on Eve&#39;s head. &#34;To the best fucking cop in the whole stinking city, who&#39;s gonna marry the sexiest sumbitch I, personally, have ever laid eyes on, and who, because she&#39;s so goddamn smart, has seen to it that I&#39;m perman&#39;ly attached to Homicide. Which is where any half-blind asshole could tell you I belong. So there.&#34; She downed the rest of her drink, fell backward into her chair, and grinned foolishly.... Mavis. He paled a bit. Eve, tell me youre not going shopping with Mavis.His reaction brightened her mood a little. She has this friend. Hes a designer.Dear Christ.She says hes mag. Just needs a break to make a name for himself. He has a little workshop in Soho.Lets elope. Now. You look fine.Her grin flashed. Scared?Terrified.Good. Now were even. Delighted to be on level footing, she leaned in and kissed him. Now you can worry about what Ill be wearing on the big day for the next few weeks. Gotta go. She patted his cheek. Im meeting her in twenty minutes.Eve....</p>
				<p>Sigh ... Oh Roarke, you are one in a million. Would have liked to have been at the wedding though. Off to start the next one - wonder will I get tired of it after about Book 12 or so. Fans of romantic suspense, tough heroines, &amp; devoted, dangerous, deliciously sexy alpha heroes A few quick observations:-Eve&#39;s attitude can get really old really fast.-If Roarke doesn&#39;t want to be frustrated by Eve&#39;s lack of confidence in their emotional intimacy, he shouldn&#39;t push her to do things she doesn&#39;t want to do (like, oh, say marriage).-JD Robb should have Stretched out Roarke &amp; Eve&#39;s relationship further before marriage,...</p>
