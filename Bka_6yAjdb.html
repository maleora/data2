				<h3>More About <span>Lorna Sass&#39; Complete Vegetarian Kitchen: Where Good Flavors and Good Health Meet</span></h3>
				<p></p>
				<p>This is my favorite cookbook! I love it, and use it all the time. It is also great because it has times for a pressure cooker, which is so handy for a busy family!!(Don&#39;t be scared of pressure cookers, they really are safer than your mother will tell you they are!!!!) Love, love, love! This is all vegan, despite the title as vegetarian. It would be great for someone looking for vegan recipes or for meat-eaters who want to add more vegetables to their diet that actually taste good. As someone who is not much of a cook, this is extremely helpful. It has a short section on basics to fill your pantry,... Vegans</p>
