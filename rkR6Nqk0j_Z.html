					 A Military History, History, Military book. When Adolf Hitler heard of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, he slapped his hands together in glee...
				</p>
				<p class="description">
					The classic New York Times bestselling story of heroism and sacrifice--by the author of Flags of Our Fathers, The Imperial Cruise, and The China Mirage.This acclaimed bestseller brilliantly illuminates a hidden piece of World War II history as it tells the harrowing true story of nine American airmen shot down in the Pacific. One of them, George H. W. Bush, was miraculously rescued. What happened to the other eight remained a secret for almost 60 years. After the war, the American and Japanese governments conspired to cover up the shocking truth, and not even the families of the airmen were informed of what happened to their sons. Their fate remained a mystery--until now. FLYBOYS is a tale of courage and daring, of war and death, of men and hope. It will make you proud and it will break your heart.

				<h3>More About <span>Flyboys: A True Story of Courage</span></h3>
				<p>Japan was a closed book. Western ignorance of Japan was not the fault of the westerners but the design of the Japanese. For two hundred years, Japan had been shut tight. By national law, a Japanese could not leave Japan and no outsider was allowed in. Death sentences were meted out to any who gave foreigners information about the land of the gods. Almost no maps and no books existed in the English-speaking world describing the closed land. James D. Bradley, Flyboys: A True Story of Courage // Nations tend to see the other side&#39;s war atrocities as systemic and indicative of their culture and their own atrocities as justified or the acts of stressed combatants. In my travels, I sense a smoldering resentment towards WWII Japanese behavior among some Americans. Ironically, these feelings are strongest among the younger American generation that did not fight in WWII. In my experience, the Pacific vets on both sides have made their peace. And in terms of judgments, I will leave it to those who were there. As Ray Gallagher, who flew on both atomic... True combat power is arms multiplied by fighting spirit. If one of them is infinitely strong, you will succeed. Asahi Shimbun newspaper, quoted in Japan at War: An Oral History James D. Bradley, Flyboys: A True Story of Courage //</p>
				<p>For Christmas, I got this as a book on tape, but I enjoyed the first chapters so much that I went out and bought the book. James Bradley&#39;s writing is elegant and well researched. I enjoyed learning about the Doolittle Raid, Tokyo Fire Raid and hearing about President George H.W. Bush and his time as a flyboy.I would have liked to hear... I don&#39;t give out 5 stars too often, and this one should get a six. The stories in this book had to be told, and they had to be told in a particular way. Bradley does a masterful job in relating the horrific details of what happened to 8 U.S. pilots on a speck of earth called Chichi Jima. The fact that this island is not a WWII household... Flyboys, WWII history buffs</p>
