				<p class="description">
					Inside every adult is an instinctive desire to help and serve others. It&#39;s also part of our nature to want to do things that keep us engaged and excited about getting up in the morning. If you&#39;ve figured out how to bring this balance into your life, others will want to hear about the information, ideas, knowledge and strategies you&#39;ve used to build and live a more fulfilling life. You are an expert at something, and we all possess knowledge or information that can help others.
